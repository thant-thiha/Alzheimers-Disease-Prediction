# Alzheimer's Disease Prediction

**Goal:** Develop an accurate, data-driven approach for predicting Alzheimer's disease presence and stage using patient health and cognitive data.

## Project Overview
- Used patient datasets including demographics, clinical, cognitive and genetic factors.
- Focused on early identification to support intervention and care planning.

## Approach
- Comprehensive data cleaning and feature engineering (e.g. handling missing values, encoding variables).
- Built and compared several classification models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, and others.
- Best model chosen for accuracy and interpretability.

## Key Findings
- Age, cognitive assessment scores, and genetic markers are top predictors.
- Random Forest achieved highest accuracy, but Logistic Regression offered easier interpretability for clinical settings.
- Early detection models can help identify at-risk individuals before severe deterioration.

## Recommendations
- Deploy the selected model as a clinical decision support tool.
- Periodically update the model with new patient data.
- Further refine model with expanded features and larger datasets.
